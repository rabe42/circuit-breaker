# CircuitBreaker

The implementation of an circuit breaker, you find here, was inspired by the C# implementation of
Tim Ross
(https://timross.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/implementing-the-circuit-breaker-pattern-in-c/).
It does not implement the SLA enhancements, described in the article, but sticks to the basic
function as described in Release-IT by T. Nygard.

# Example
´´´
fn main() ...
´´´
